        amyrobson 1 month ago Impressive! Though it seems the drag feature could
        be improved. But overall it looks incredible. You've nailed the design
        and the responsiveness at various breakpoints works really well.

        maxblagun 2 weeks ago Woah, your project looks awesome! How long have
        you been coding for? I'm still new, but think I want to dive into React
        as well soon. Perhaps you can give me an insight on where I can learn
        React? Thanks!

          ramsesmiron 1 week ago @maxblagun If you're still new, I'd recommend
          focusing on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS before considering
          React. It's very tempting to jump ahead but lay a solid foundation
          first.

          juliusomo 2 days ago @ramsesmiron I couldn't agree more with this.
          Everything moves so fast and it always seems like everyone knows the
          newest library/framework. But the fundamentals are what stay constant.
